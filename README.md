# Read Me

I really want to learn these subjects well. I tend to learn things well when I write code and try to experiment with concepts in writing myself.

Most everything will be written in julia. All code will be written modular enough so that it is pretty applicable to a variety of projects and/or tasks. If you have any questions or would like to use this code, please feel free to reach out to me at [pranaygundam00@gmail.com](mailto:pranaygundam00@gmail.com).
