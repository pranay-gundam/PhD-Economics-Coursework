# Context

The description of this repository is pretty self explanatory. I took PhD Macro I at NYU during Fall 2023 and figured out that I indeed do want to do macro when it comes to econ focus during grad school. I find that my personal endeavors in writing code and working with concepts is what helps me learn best and so this repo is just that.

As of right now, the job search code and documentation is a bit further along than the OLG code. I am not sure when I intend on finishing up both repos or if I will ever come to a point where I will consider it finished. Regardless I'll continue to write code until I'm done with another first semester of Macro during grad school (maybe even envelop this repo into a larger one with code relating to the general Macro sequence).

I wrote a few things in python but most everything will be in julia.
