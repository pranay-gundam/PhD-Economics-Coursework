# Basic Case
# Two households born at the same time with same preferences and
# statespace beliefs. Households live for two periods and one household
# recieves endowment (x,0) and second household makes endowment (0,x)

# The obvious answer here is that given the utility function is concave
# (people want to consumption smooth) the housholds should trade half of 
# their endowment with the other household
